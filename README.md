# TextEditor(Using GTK+2.0)
I have created an text editor like gedit using GTK library. It can open a existing file, creat a new file, save the changes, 
can do many operations like inserting at cursor, cut, copy, paste, delete, find , find and replace, go to line etc.
       To install my software you have to download it first, and then 
       1) type 'make' in terminal
       2) type './project'  or './project <filename>' 
       3) text editor is opened 
       4) to close text editor use ctrl+q or quit in file menu
